**Instructions for use**

This program enscribes a provided message in a specified format, either ASCII characters, Braille(represented by bits), or Unicode(Braille dot symbols).
To enscribe an ASCII message to Braille bits, provide the CLAs 'braille' and your message.
To enscribe an ASCII message to Braille dots, provide the CLAs 'unicode' and your message.
To enscribe a Braille bit string to ASCII characters, provide the CLAs 'ascii' and your message as a bit string.
